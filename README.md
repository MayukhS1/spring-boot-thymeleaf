# spring-boot-thymeleaf
Created the project from: [spring.io!](https://start.spring.io/) and created a new spring boot project named **spring-boot-thymeleaf** with *Thymeleaf and web as dependency.*

## what is thymeleaf?
Thymeleaf is an engine that builds dynamic pages from templates that are written in XHTML with the help of some special attributes, so it is a template engine.

A template engine is an engine that parses XHTML/HTML pages that contain special tags or attributes or syntax that is bound to variables at the server, and resolves them into their values, then parses the page according to those values and builds a normal HTML page.

Thymeleaf is an in-memory template engine, so it does all of it's processing in memory, it builds a DOM that maps to the HTML of the page in-memory and when values change the parsed pages are changed, also it's caching is an in-memory caching system.

Thymeleaf is a template engine that relays mostly on attributes instead of tags like what JSP would do, this makes it testable in the browser directly without requiring a server.

Those attributes are then translated and processed by Thymeleaf into normal HTML.
